                <h3>Food for Thought</h3>
                <img src="images/food-thought.jpg" alt="food for thought image" class="round">
                <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. 
                    Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>
                <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent 
                    change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.</p> 
                <p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your 
                    activity level and calories.</p>
                <p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>

                <h3>What to Eat</h3>
                <img src="images/fresh-food.jpg" alt="fresh vegetables, fruit, eggs, and nuts" class="round">
                <p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
                    <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
                    <li>Fruit</li>
                    <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.</p>
                <p>When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, 
                    almond flour, and flax seed.</p>
